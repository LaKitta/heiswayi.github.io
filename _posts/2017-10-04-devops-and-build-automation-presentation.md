There was a time when I was working as Build and Release Engineer, I had been given a chance to present a simple talk about **DevOps and Build Automation** to my software team. I have uploaded my presentation slides to [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/HeiswayiNrird/devops-and-build-automation) which titled "Introduction to DevOps and Build Automation Update" as part of knowledge sharing. Here is the embedded version from my SlideShare.
